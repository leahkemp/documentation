This document described how to download or create a design file that can be used as an input in [human_genomics_pipeline](https://github.com/ESR-NZ/human_genomics_pipeline) and [vcf_annotation_pipeline](https://github.com/ESR-NZ/vcf_annotation_pipeline) when analysing whole exome sequencing data (WES). Such files record which regions were targeted by whole exome sequencing. This can speed up the analyses in these genomic pipelines by providing known genomic intervals to analyse.

## Agilent [SureSelect capture kits](https://www.agilent.com/en/product/next-generation-sequencing/hybridization-based-next-generation-sequencing-ngs/exome-probes/sureselect-human-all-exon-v7-232866)

Design files for WES generated with the Agilent capture kit can be downloaded or created using [SureDesign](https://earray.chem.agilent.com/suredesign/home.htm)

First create an account with SureSelect (help with using this resource can be found [here](https://earray.chem.agilent.com/suredesign/help/WebHelp.htm#Create_a_SureSelect_design_with_the_wizard.htm)) and log in.

### Download existing design files

- Select SureSelect within the 'Find designs' tab
- Search for your capture kit within the 'Agilent catalog'
- Download and unzip files
